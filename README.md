# Github Service Webhook for Podio

If you use Podio as a bug tracker this simple web service allows you to close and reference bugs via Git commit messages. It's a bit rough in the edges in terms of documentation an configurability, but it is heavily used by the Podio development teams.

## Deploying to Heroku
``` sh
heroku create my-podio-github
heroku config:set \
  PODIO_CLIENT_ID="REDACTED" \
  PODIO_CLIENT_SECRET="REDACTED"
git push heroku master
```

Alternatively, you can deploy your own copy with one click using this button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/podio/podio-github-public)

See the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) for more info about changing the configuration variables after deployment.

## Configuration

Configure your Github repository to use this as a Service webhook.

 * Look up your app id and token on Podio for your Bugs app (Wrench icon -> Developer)
 * Go to Settings -> Service Hooks -> WebHook URLs on the repository you want to configure
 * Construct your URL like this: `https://my-podio-github.heroku.com/hook?app_id=BUG_APP_ID&app_token=BUG_APP_TOKEN`
 * The Content Type should be set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
 * Add this URL as a WebHook URL on Github
 * Click "Test Hook" to see if it works

## Usage

This assumes your Bugs app in Podio has a category field called 'Status' which includes a category named 'Fixed'. If this is not the case, you have to adapt the code.

The Webhook will receive all your pushes and searches commit messages on the master branch for text in the form of:

    command #1
    command #1, #2
    command #1 & #2
    command #1 and #2

Instead of the short-hand syntax "#1", "ticket:1" can be used as well, e.g.:

    command ticket:1
    command ticket:1, ticket:2
    command ticket:1 & ticket:2
    command ticket:1 and ticket:2

In addition, the ':' character can be omitted and issue or bug can be used instead of ticket.

You can have more than one command in a message. The following commands are supported. There is more than one spelling for each command, to make this as user-friendly as possible.

 * `close`, `closed`, `closes`, `fix`, `fixed`, `fixes`: The specified tickets are set to 'Fixed' and the commit message is added to them as a comment.
 * `references`, `refs`, `addresses`, `re`, `see`: The specified tickets are left in their current state, and the commit message is added to them as a comment.

A fairly complicated example of what you can do is with a commit message of:

    Changed blah and foo to do this or that. Fixes #10 and #12, and refs #12.

This will close #10 and #12, and add a note to #12.

## Tasks and stories

At Podio, we plan our development work as user stories, and we break each story into tasks. The code here also has examples for how to close a task and even register time on it, and how to close a story.

The `APP_ID` and `APP_TOKEN` for the `TaskPoster` and the `StoryPoster` must be manually setup in `podio_poster.rb` if you wish to make use of them.


## Test

The tests do not run out of the box. This is a tricky service to test, as it modifies live Podio data.
